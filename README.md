# SwiftNIOMock
A web server based on [SwiftNIO](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio) designed to be used as a mock server in UI automation tests.

When running UI tests against real server several issues can come along: network can be unstable, content on the remote server can change, some of the test scenarios may require actions in some external system, and in general making network calls slows down all the tests.

SwiftNIOMock aims to address these issues by providing a mock web server implementation that runs on the `localhost` and which app should access instead of a real server when running under UI test. Unlike other solutions like registering custom `URLProtocol` using mock server requires only switching the app to the `localhost` and gives you much more flexibility and control as the server is controlled by the test and you can change its state from within the test scenarios. 

SwiftNIOMock supports three common scenarios:

- redirect requests to the real service using `redirect` middleware. This can be used for logging purposes which can make debugging easier as all the network logs will be in the console log of the test runner process

- mock endpoints using `router` middleware. This is useful when you need to have more control over the state of the mock server and allows you to completely mock out all network requests the app makes (although it can be used along with `redirect` middleware). This is usually needed when tests scenarios require actions in some external systems. When you control the state of the server completely you can easily fake such actions

- record & replay network calls using `redirect` middleware provided with the implementation of `URLSession` that can record and replay requests (using [Vinyl](https://github.com/Velhotes/Vinyl) or any other similar implementation). This is useful to ensure that tests receive the same data between runs and aims to guard against changes on the remote server that are out of your control

## Usage

In the test create an instance of the server and start it in the `setUp` method and provide it with a middleware to handle requests. In the `tearDown` method stop the server.

```swift
override func setUp() {
    server = Server(port: 8080, handler: <#Middleware#>)
    try! server.start()
}

override func tearDown() {
    try! server.stop()
    server = nil
}
```

A middleware is a function that is based on an incoming request can modify a response. 

```swift
typealias Middleware = (
    _ request: MiddlewareRequest,
    _ response: MiddlewareResponse,
    _ next: @escaping () -> Void
) -> Void
```

When middleware function is done with response it should call the `next` closure (it's fine to call it asynchronously) that is passed to it to return control to the server.  You can write your own middleware or use those provided by SwiftNIOMock, which are `redirect`, `router` and `delay`.  Here is an example of a simple middleware that echoes back any incoming request:

```swift
func echo(
    request: MiddlewareRequest,
    response: MiddlewareResponse,
    next: @escaping () -> Void
) {
    response.statusCode = .ok
    response.body = request.body
    next()
}
```

It's important to call the `next` closure when your middlewere has finished its work, otherwise the server won't close connection and send data properly.

`redirect` middleware allows you to redirect incoming requests and intercept responses. It also accepts an instance of `URLSession` (`URLSession.shared` session by default) that it will use to perform a request, which allows it to record & replay all requests. Check out `SwiftNIOMockExampleUITests.swift` to see the example of how to use SwiftNIOMock in record & replay mode powered by Vinyl.

```swift
func redirect(
    session: URLSession = URLSession.shared,
    request override: @escaping (Server.HTTPHandler.Request) -> Server.HTTPHandler.Request,
    response intercept: @escaping (Server.HTTPHandler.Response) -> Void = { _ in }
) -> Middleware
```

`router` middleware allows you to return arbitrary middleware based on a request, i.e. its method and path. If request can't be handled a fallback middleware passed as `notFound` parameter will be used.

```swift
func router(
    notFound: @escaping Middleware,
    route: @escaping (Server.HTTPHandler.Request) -> Middleware?
) -> Middleware
```

### Routing

SwiftNIOMock comes with a builtin routing based on regular expressions. You can define routes for common HTTP methods:

```swift
GET("/helloworld") { _, response, next in
    response.sendString(.ok, value: "Hello world!")
    next()
})

POST("/register") { request, response, next in
    // process data from request.http.body
    response.sendString(.ok, value: "Hello world!")
    next()
})
```

Route can be matched either against raw regular expression string or patterns created with custom `/`, `/?` and `&` operators:

```swift
/"hello"/?"name=world" == #"/hello/\?name=world"#
```

You can use `.string`, `.number`, `.any`, `.path` operators to match path components and query parameters:

```swift
GET(/"user"/.string/"repos"/?.number("page")&.string("filter")) { request, response, next in
    print(request.captures[0] as String) // "apple"
    print(request.captures["page"] as Int) // 1
    print(request.captures["filter"] as String) // "swift"
    next()
})
```

If you are already using some other routing framework in your app, i.e. for your deeplinks, you can plug it in by passing your own routing middleware to `router(notFound:route:)`.
